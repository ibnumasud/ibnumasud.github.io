Hello Kids,  
  
Yesterday, I was drinking coffee in [TSM](http://www.transstudiomall.com/) Bandung. Actually, I'm not a coffee addict nor coffee hater. When I wanna drink some coffee, I usually bought coffee sachets or coffee cans. But sometimes, I have to choose from the coffee shop menu,  I always choose cappuccino. Why I choose cappuccino? because I already taste it and it suit my taste, everybody happy. Simplicity win kids haha.  
  
The story begin when my little "big" brother ask me to choose another taste. I thing this idea is not really bad, because coffee is coffee \*yeah I'm newbie\*.  So I choose another menu, the list is americano, espresso, macchiato. I choose espresso based on my little knowledge about candies, there are kopiko candies and espresso candies, both of them are good. The second reason is my rule of thumbs coffee is coffee \*indeed\*.  
  
The result is when the first time I taste it, my eyes were closed, the coffee is greatly bitter.  I looked at the glass and thinking is it the black coffee?? I taste it again and again, why the coffee shop put espresso in that menu!! Finally, I surrender, I give it to your uncle cappuccino and mix it, and of course I ask him to share the cappuccino haha. But, it is to late kids, the great great bitter coffee is still there for several hours.  
  
So I do a little research for your sake, here is my latest knowledge replace coffee is coffee rule of thumbs :  
  
1\. Black Coffee "Kopi Item"  
You put black coffee and put some water, that is "kopi item"  
  
2\. Espresso  
They said it is different with black coffee, you have to use coffee machine to push some air into the coffee, but I thing this is will be the same taste with "kopi item" right?  
  
3\. Americano  
Espresso with a little more water  
  
4\. Macchiato  
Espresso with some milk on top of that. They said it will protect espresso from the outer contamination. But, when you drink it, which part will you taste first, I still don't get it. May be this is the version of "Kopi Susu" in Our Country.  
  
5\. Cappuccino  
Mix of coffee, cream, milk, and chocolate with the same composition. is it coffee, milk or chocolate?? I couldn't answer that.  
  
I hope this post help you a little kids, enjoy your coffee.  
  
Your Dad,
