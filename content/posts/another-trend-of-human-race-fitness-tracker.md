Hello Kids,  
  
Another post for this year hurrah!!  
  
In 2016 there is another fancy thing that everyone talk about, yep yep that is fitness tracker. Based on google play download, fitness application is the most popular download for 2015. Therefore all about fitness equipment is trendy for now. From running shoes, jacket, and off course fitness tracker.  
  
I'm one of many people that caught in this phenomenon. I already buy ... (Ups your mama gonna hate me if I told you here).  
  
For fitness tracker there are so many alternative, for now I want to tell you about vivofit 2.  
Why I choose vivofit 2, because vivofit 2 is strong fitness tracker, you don't have to charge this thing, it is very important because my daily activity already had quite troublesome with charging phone. You just have to change this battery every 1-2 year (brochure told me that).  
  
With this vivofit 2 you could track your walking step, running activity, sleep but not for swimming and heart monitoring. Actually for heart monitoring you could buy another garmin gadget that could be embedded to vivofit 2.  
  
Here are some picture for vivofit 2 :

Also Vivofit 2 have application garmin application for sync. The app name is garmin connect. The application is easy to use and could synchronize to other application like nike run, endomondo, my fitness pal. But, I thing this vivofit 2 has inconsistent for running monitoring. Because, my pace is + 2 minutes if using vivofit 2 haha :p, and when I track the same route it doesn't return the same distance for 1 Kilometer. Overall vivofit 2 is a good health trend that you should buy if you have some additional money.

Vivofit 2 price is about 1.5 million on Dec 2015. Another tips is, there is button beside the main screen. This button used for initial pairing with phone, sync activity,  begin run, begin sleep etc. This is very very important because when I bought, I couldn't find it, the manual book doesn't told me about this button!! Happy running kids.
