Hello Kids,  
  
Do you have visited batam island? Batam is indonesian island nearest to Singapore. If you wanna swim from here to Singapore, I thing you could. It cost about Rp 400.000 for one round-trip from Batam to Singapore using boat.

Singapore from Harbour Bay

If you ask me about where you should go in batam, hmm it is really hard to tell you haha.  
The transportation is not so good, taxi in here is a little bit expensive, but you could use taxi with angkot taste. Yeah, it happen here, you could use taxi with another customer! it called comprengan.  
  
There are only two or three mall, I went to the biggest mall called nagoya hill batam, and there are nothing special in there. Wops, i forgot, if you went to batam you should buy your mama perfume or some branded bag in here. Because batam is free trade zone, but be careful for fake brand. There are so many 'kw' in here,  you have to got the feeling for that kid.  
  
The hotel, it cost about Rp 500.000 for medium hotel, but if you wanna save your money, you could search for some building with two or three storey building. It cost about Rp 190.000. But it is a little bit cheesy in here haha. There are some girl in the dark place, massage, karaoke and bar.  Nah I would't go out tonight.
