Hello Kids,  
  
How are you doing? have you exercise today?  
If you ask me, of course I have.  
  
Compare to other sports, I do really like running. Why? I don't know exactly why, but I think this sport have the right compositions that fit my body. For me, running means you push refresh button for your body and soul.  
  
But believe me kids, I'm a lazy head person that choose pillow over running shoes, so i wish you Mama like running a bit too,  so she could be my catalyst that push my laziness haha.    
  
So get up and wear your running shoes Kids!
