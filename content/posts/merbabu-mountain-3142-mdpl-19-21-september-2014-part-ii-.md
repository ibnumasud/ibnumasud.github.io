Hello Kids,  
  
Yesterday, my friend ask me to share tips and trick when I was in Rinjani Mountain. Actually I will write about rinjani mountain. But, I have promises to you, to finish merbabu story.  
Yes, please note it, I choose you kids haha. Nah, the main reason is because I don't have any rinjani mountain picture in this laptop. Rinjani is a beautiful mountain kids, you should go there.  
  
Okay, let's talk about another beautiful mountain, in previous [merbabu story](http://dusamunbi.blogspot.com/2014/11/merbabu-mountain-3142-mdpl-19-21.html), I already told you about post 1-3 using Wekas path.  
  
Merbabu have three peaks, from wekas path, the nearest is syarif peak.  The other is kenteng songo peak  and not far from kenteng songo, there are triangulasi peak. We planned to kenteng songo for Summit Attack, from post 3 to kenteng songo could be reached about 3-4 hours. Unfortunately, the situation is not so good at 2 o'clock in the morning. The wind blowing really-really high that night, that are limit when you talk about nature kids, you could't agains it. We are small creature in this world who doesn't worthy to be arrogant.  
  
So instead of kenteng songo, we planned to go to Syarif peak. The track is full of dust with a little bit high altitude, so you have to use your hand to climb the way.  
  
Tired, cold, and sleepy is something that you get when you climb in the morning kids.  But, you don't have to worries about that, we won't leave you there. Human are stronger when together, so what you should do is take one step a head and enjoy the nature. No matter how long it takes, if you take one step forward you could arrived at the peak of the world \*cheesy haha\*.  
  
Here is the picture when I was in syarif peak.

After that we go to kenteng songo peak, triangulasi peak, and go back using selo path. Selo path is much much more dusty kids, and hot. These path are full of savanna and some tree near the base selo path. So you should bring eye glasses, masker, and sunblock.

Our Sponsor :p

Selo path takes about 5-6 hours. Selo path have some tricky path, because you will see only the nearest hill, be careful if you choose selo path. 

  

Here are some picture from selo path.
