Hello Kids,  
  
Today i will tell you about my story in Merbabu. Merbabu is a volcano mountain in central java,  merbabu derived from word "maharu = meru" (mountain) and "abu" = ash. That is really really real kids, there are a lot of dust in merbabu. So if you wanna go to merbabu mountain you should bring eyeglass and masker for your own sake.  
  
Here is sneak a peek about merbabu mountain.  

  

The story begin when we start our journey from bandung railway station. We went to jogja at 08.00 A.M and arrived at jogja in the morning

JZZZ blurr,  my face is sleepy as hell 

After that, we go to the first hiking point. We are using wekas track, it is very very cold in there, you don't have to get water from refrigerator if you wanna drink something cold.

Be grateful to your mama kids! 

After two or three hours walking, we arrived in post 1, the track is not very high, but there are so many cliff on the road, so you have to be careful. 

  

Within two hours walk  from post 1 you would arrived in Post 2. In here you could refill your water, and make camp.  We eat some snack and pray here, but we wouldn't camp here, because we want to get the sunrise, so it is better camp in Post 3. Beside you could see beautiful sky with beautiful clouds, with beautiful scenery and beautiful (\*yeah so many beautiful thing in merbabu), but there are no water in Post 3 , so you have to save your water.
